- **User service**. Express service that handles the insertion of new users in the system.
- **Auth service**. Express service that handles the authentication of users.
- **LLM service**. Express service that handles the communication with the LLM.
- **Gateway service**. Express service that is exposed to the public and serves as a proxy to the two previous ones.
