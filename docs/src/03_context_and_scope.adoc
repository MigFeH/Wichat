== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

The following table describes the business context, outlining the key actors interacting with the system and their relationships.

[options="header"]
|===
| Actor | Type | Description | Interaction with the System
| Players | External | Users who access the application to play the game. | Interact with the web interface, receive random locations, request hints from the LLM, and submit guesses.
| LLM Provider | External | API service providing AI-generated hints for players. | Receives user queries and returns contextual hints about the player's location.
| Web Application | Internal | The frontend React-based web application. | Displays the game interface, processes user interactions, and communicates with backend services.
| Gateway Service | Internal | API gateway handling requests between the frontend and backend services. | Routes user requests, manages authentication, and forwards LLM-related queries.
| Authentication Service | Internal | Manages user authentication and access control. | Handles user login, registration, and session management.
| User Service | Internal | Manages user-related data, including game history and scores. | Stores and retrieves user data, including past game records.
| Database | Internal | MongoDB instance storing user and game data. | Stores user accounts, game sessions, and interaction logs.
| Deployment Platform | External | Cloud-based hosting service (e.g., AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean). | Hosts the web application, backend services, and database.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

**Diagram or Table**

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Component | Description

| **Agent User (External User)** 
| Interacts with the Web App, serving as the system’s end user.

| **Web App (View Layer - Frontend)** 
| Sends requests to and receives responses from the Backend. Acts as a bridge between the external user and backend services.

| **Backend (Controller Layer - Node.js API)** 
| Serves as the central hub that manages communication between components. Handles authentication, user management, and external interactions. Routes requests to the appropriate services in the Service Layer.

| **Service Layer (Business Logic)** 
| Contains core business logic. Processes requests from the Controller Layer and interfaces with the Model Layer to access data.

| **Model Layer (Database & Data Access Layer)** 
| Uses Mongoose ORM to interact with MongoDB. Defines schemas and performs all database operations.
|===


#### Technical Interfaces
- **Web App & Backend**: HTTP Requests/Responses.
- **Backend & Service Layer**: Internal function calls.
- **Service Layer & Model Layer**: Database queries.
- **Model Layer & MongoDB**: Data storage and retrieval.

##### Mapping Input/Output to Channels
[cols="3", options="header"]
|===
| Component | Input | Output
| Web App | User Requests | UI Responses
| Backend (Controller Layer) | API Calls | Processed Data
| Service Layer | Business Logic Requests | Business Logic Responses
| Model Layer | Database Queries | Stored/Retrieved Data
| MongoDB | Queries | Stored Data
